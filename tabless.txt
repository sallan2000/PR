Design progress bar is a bit unnecessary, properties are configured before tabless opens, default schedule is none i.e. run on demand, only criteria and attributes would contributes to progress...

Gen AI piece is not dedicated to criteria building as it adds/removes attributes, so where does the button go?

History page cannot be refreshed as a modal dialog as the refresh button (all floating dialogs would need their own refresh button)

Add attributes from Criteria button to the main tabless view

Drag and Drop, do we need it?
